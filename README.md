## Vision Statement
Many people love the thrill and excitement of horror games. Nothing is quite as scary as playing a game at home, alone, at night, in first person, and having a monster jump at you on your screen. For anyone who loves having fun and being a little scared, **Scary Maze** is the game for you.

**Scary Maze** is a PC game that keeps the player uneasy and has some frights in store. The player is tasked with completing mazes of increasing difficulty and size, with only a limited light source and items. While doing this, they must be on the lookout for monsters, which they may need to fight in order to progress.

This game was made in the spirit of such games as the *Silent Hill* series, or more recently, the *Outlast* series and even *Five Nights at Freddy's*. However, unlike those games, the mazes in **Scary Maze** are randomly generated, resulting in a different experience each time the player plays.

If you are a fan of horror, then you will love **Scary Maze**!
